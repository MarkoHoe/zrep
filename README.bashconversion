Notes on things that had to be done to convert zrep
from ksh to bash

- Replace print with echo

- for some function outputs, forced use of "echo -n" instead of just echo

- for printf %(xx)T "#seconds", convert to
  printf %(xx)T "seconds"

- also printf T:
   printf '%(%s)T' now
  becomes
   printf '%(%s)T'
